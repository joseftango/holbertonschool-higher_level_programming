===============================
apply doctest in 100-matrix_mul
===============================

This library is very simple, since it only has one function called
``matrix_mul()``.

``matrix_mul()`` function that multiplies 2 matrices.

import our function matrix_mul()
	>>> matrix_mul = __import__('100-matrix_mul').matrix_mul

let's use it :

Test case #0: Testing 2 lists with same rows and columns
>>> matrix_mul([[1, 2], [3, 4]], [[1, 2], [3, 4]])
[[7, 10], [15, 22]]

Test case #1: Testing 1st list nums of columns same as numbers of rows for 2nd list
>>> matrix_mul([[1, 2]], [[3, 4], [5, 6]])
[[13, 16]]
