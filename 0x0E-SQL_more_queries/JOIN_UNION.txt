...================|*********** JOIN TYPES *************|==================...
...****************======================================******************...


INNER JOIN :
it returns only the record of the equal values from specified column

SELECT * FROM Customer INNER JOIN City on Customer.cityid = City.cityid

note :
INNER JOIN keyword works only with = condition

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

RIGHT JOIN :
it returns only the records of the common values from specified column and
the rest attributes of the RIGHT (after JOIN) specified table.

ex:
SELECT * FROM Customer RIGHT JOIN City on Customer.cityid = City.cityid

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

LEFT JOIN :
it returns only the records of the common values from specified column and
the rest attributes of the LEFT (before JOIN) specified table.

ex:
SELECT * FROM Customer LEFT JOIN City on Customer.cityid = City.cityid


FULL JOIN :
it returns only the records of the common values from specified column and
the rest attributes of the RIGHT (after JOIN) specified table and
LEFT (before JOIN) specified table.


ex:
SELECT * FROM Customer FULL JOIN City on Customer.cityid = City.cityid



********* UNION statement**********

ex:
SELECT name, cost, bids FROM items WHERE bids > 100
UNION
SELECT name, cost, bids FROM items WHERE cost > 1000


this will displays a union tables with combining between the two condition

note :
when the query has been executed the UNION automatically remove the duplicates
record which mutchs with both of this two conditions if we want to list this duplicated records
we have to use :
UNION ALL


ex 2:
now we will applicate UNION from table to other table :

SELECT cLastName AS "Last Name", cFirstName AS "First Name",
cPhone as "Phone", 'Customer' AS "Company"
FROM customers
UNION
SELECT repLName, repFName, repPhone, sCompanyName
FROM suppliers
ORDER BY "Last Name";


note :
without talking about attributes the important that it must has the same number
and same datatype if that didn't has same <attribute name> it normal.
