*************** subquerie in mysql****************

as a remainder :
to choose a database for working in it :

mysql> USE <database_name>;

to list all tables that contained in the current database :

mysql> SHOW TABLES;


======= subquerie with SELECT statement ======= :

in this example we will use subqueries for listing values in some specific columns
which has the values less than average value of the choosen attribute :

SELECT emp_name, dept, salary
FROM employees
WHERE salary < (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees);



-----------------------------------------------------

NATURAL JOIN :
it makes us retrive the specific attributes with it values by a column or more which contain
inside other table with same values.

ex:

SELECT DISTINCT prodName, unitSalePrice
FROM Products NATURAL JOIN OrderLines
WHERE unitSalePrice > the average unit sale price
