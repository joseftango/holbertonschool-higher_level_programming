very important if this error is still exists :
ERROR 2002 (HY000): Can't connect to local MySQL server through socket

visit this link :

or you can type this command :
$ sudo service mysql start




# CREATE USER :
this command allows you to create a new user in your mysql server

ex:

# CREATE USER [IF NOT EXISTS] account_name

IDENTIFIED BY 'password';

or :

# CREATE USER 'username'@'host' IDENTIFIED WITH authentication_plugin BY 'password';

Run the following command to create a user that authenticates with 'caching_sha2_password'
by (default) Be sure to change sammy to your preferred username and password
to a strong password of your choosing:

>>> CREATE USER 'sammy'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';


we can choose authentication :
	# CREATE USER 'sammy'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'password';

****Granting a User Permissions:

	>>> GRANT PRIVILEGE ON database.table TO 'username'@'host';

Run this GRANT statement, replacing sammy with your own MySQL
user’s name, to grant these privileges to your user:

	>>> GRANT CREATE, ALTER, DROP, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, SELECT, REFERENCES, RELOAD on *.* TO 'sammy'@'localhost' WITH GRANT OPTION;


Warning: Some users may want to grant their MySQL user the ALL PRIVILEGES :

	>>> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'sammy'@'localhost' WITH GRANT OPTION;


if we need to revoke a permission :
	>>> REVOKE type_of_permission ON database_name.table_name FROM 'username'@'host';


review a user’s current permissions by running the SHOW GRANTS command:

	>>> SHOW GRANTS FOR 'username'@'host';


Just as you can delete databases with DROP, you can use DROP to delete a user:

	>>> DROP USER 'username'@'localhost';


After creating your MySQL user and granting them privileges, you can exit the MySQL client:

	>>>mysql> exit


In the future, to log in as your new MySQL user, you’d use a command like the following:

	>>> mysql -u root -p
